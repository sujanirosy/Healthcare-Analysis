# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze patient data to uncover insights into the efficiency of our healthcare system, patient satisfaction, and the dynamics of healthcare demand. Our analysis covers several key metrics:

1. **Average Wait Time**
2. **Patient Satisfaction**
3. **Total Patient Visits Monthly**
4. **Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments**
5. **Referrals and Walk-In Patients**
6. **Patient Visits by Age Group and Race**

## Data Analysis

### Average Wait Time
- **Objective**: Determine the average wait time for patients and identify patterns that could indicate the efficiency of the healthcare system.
- **Methodology**: Analyze appointment data to calculate the average wait time from check-in to the actual appointment time.

### Patient Satisfaction
- **Objective**: Assess the average satisfaction scores from patient feedback.
- **Methodology**: Collect and analyze satisfaction surveys to understand factors contributing to patient experience.

### Total Patient Visits Monthly
- **Objective**: Monitor the monthly patient visit count to understand healthcare demand trends.
- **Methodology**: Aggregate patient visit data on a monthly basis to observe seasonal trends and other patterns.

### Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments
- **Objective**: Differentiate between administrative and clinical appointments and their impact on patient experience.
- **Methodology**: Categorize appointments based on their nature and analyze corresponding wait times and satisfaction levels.

### Referrals and Walk-In Patients
- **Objective**: Examine the ratio of referred to walk-in patients and its effect on the healthcare system.
- **Methodology**: Track the source of appointments and compare the experiences of referred patients versus walk-ins.

### Patient Visits by Age Group and Race
- **Objective**: Explore the distribution of patient visits across different demographics.
- **Methodology**: Analyze patient data to identify trends and preferences among various age groups and races.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For initial data sorting and basic analysis.
- **PowerBI**: To create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing large datasets.
- **Python**: For advanced data analysis and statistical modeling.
